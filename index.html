<h1>About Me</h1>

<br \>
Hi, I'm Bertan, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Bonn.
My research interests include 3D Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Intelligent Systems.
Currently, I am preparing my Master's thesis.
<br \>
<br \>
I work as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de">Autonomous Intelligent Systems Group</a>, supervised by Prof. Dr. Sven Behnke.
My work spans Person Detection, Re-Identification and Tracking using multiple sensors, Robotics Systems Integration, and 3D Scene Understanding.
I develop and implement methods for our domestic service robots participating in the <a href="https://athome.robocup.org">RoboCup@Home</a> competitions.
<br \>
<br \>
Outside of my work and studies, I enjoy playing the piano, reading science-fiction, and running.
